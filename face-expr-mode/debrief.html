          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Background.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;In our daily lives, we interact with various people, for instance, family members, friends, or audiences in a classroom. And it is not difficult to perceive social signals from others' behaviors and facial expressions. Especially, faces deliver plentiful information, including identity and emotion. One may intuitively think that recognition of identity and perception of emotion are very similar. However, that may not be always true. For instance, psychopaths might recognize others' identity well, while having difficulties in catching others' feelings. Some studies assumed two separate mechanisms for processing facial identity and facial expression (Haxby et al., 2000). On the other hand, other studies found a correlation between those two abilities (Palermo et al., 2013).</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">One limitation of the previous studies, however, is that they always asked participants to make judgments about a single face. Even in a trivial social encounter, we usually meet multiple people at once and perceive their faces and emotional expressions with a glance. The purpose of the current study is to investigate a correlation between the two abilities (recognition of identity and perception of emotion) in a more ecologically valid setting, that is, multiple faces in a single scene. With the current study, we hope to acquire broad understanding of human face perception abilities when interacting with a crowd.</p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Purpose.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;In this study, we intend to investigate the relationship between people's abilities to recognize identity from a crowd of faces and perceive facial expressions from a crowd of faces.</p>
