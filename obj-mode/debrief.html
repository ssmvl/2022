          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Background.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;We can easily recognize friend's face even under poor lighting conditions. Recent studies suggest that this superb face recognition ability may be a result of life-long exposure to tons of different faces, rather than an innate ability. For instance, Sunday and colleagues (2019) found that people from populated cities were better at face recognition compared to people from small towns with fewer population. It is possible that people have acquired face recognition ability in the same way as bird experts learned to recognize different species of birds.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; text-indent: 4em;">Other researchers have focused on evolutionary advantages of superb face recognition ability. Recent evidence supporting this view comes from studies of ensemble perception. Ensemble perception refers to an ability to estimate group characteristics from a group of objects (e.g., average size of circles; for review, see Whitney & Yamanashi Leib, 2018). Studies on ensemble perception found that people are good at estimating group characteristics from a crowd of faces (e.g., average emotion of a crowd). This ability, dubbed <em>people perception</em>, has been taken as evidence for evolutionary claims of face recognition, partly because it is difficult to imagine how people can estimate the average from a group of complex objects other than faces. The average of happy and neutral faces would be a slightly happy face, but the average of a sedan and an SUV would be a strange vehicle that is unlikely to be manufactures.</p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Purpose.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;This study intends to 1) validate a task that requires participants to estimate the mode, instead of the mean, from a group of objects, and 2) examine whether participants good at people perception are also good at ensemble perception of other complex objects such as cars or birds. A mode is defined as the most frequent value in a given set. In the context of visual estimation, the mode of a group of objects is always one of the objects in the group. That is, the mode of a group of cars comprising sedans and SUVs would be a particular model of a sedan or an SUV.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; text-indent: 4em;">In this experiment, you will view a group of objects, and then asked to choose an image that were the majority among the objects you just view. In other words, you will be asked to estimate the mode from a group of objects. We are interested in whether performance for faces correlates with performance for another category of objects. A positive correlation between performance for faces and objects of other category would suggest that people perception ability may not be an innate ability from evolutionary advantages, but an ability acquired with experiences.</p>
